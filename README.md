# StringTouch
StringTouch is a user interface design exploration translating the expressive resource of string instruments to a new interface morphology. StringTouch transfers the string as a tactile element of interaction to the touch surface, resulting in a tactilely experienceable interface. In this paper we discuss our research through design centered approach, which focused on the exploration of musical string instruments and their translation to the UI context. To investigate this specific design space, we analyzed the systematic and handling of string instruments as well as common HCI principles to develop the interaction concept. The resulting experience prototype demonstrates the idea’s potential for haptic UI design and provides insights into the prototyping process. We present: (1) the investigation of string instruments as a resource for TUI design and (2) the transfer to a generic UI context to inform new hybrid interface morphologies that combine features of tangible, touch, and flexible interaction.
